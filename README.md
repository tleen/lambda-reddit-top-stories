# lambda-reddit-top-stories
AWS Lambda function for getting Reddit's top stories. By 'top' in this context I am really talking about Reddit's 'hot' stories.

I'm still experimenting with [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/). This time it will be a lambda function to connect to a third party REST API. My goto for that is Reddit because it still allows anonymous access so I don't have to muck around with auth too.
